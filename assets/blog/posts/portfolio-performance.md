## Boosting Portfolio Performance: A Case Study

In this post, I'll walk you through the steps I took to optimize my portfolio website for performance. From image optimization to code splitting, I'll share the techniques that helped me achieve a blazing-fast user experience.

### Image Optimization

Images are often the biggest culprits when it comes to slow-loading websites. I used a combination of techniques to optimize my images, including:

*   **Choosing the right format:** I used WebP for my images, which provides a smaller file size than JPEG or PNG without sacrificing quality.
*   **Compressing images:** I used a tool to compress my images before uploading them to my website.
*   **Lazy loading:** I used lazy loading to defer the loading of images that are not in the viewport.

### Code Splitting

Code splitting is a technique that allows you to split your JavaScript code into smaller chunks, which can be loaded on demand. This can significantly improve the initial loading speed of your website.

### Caching

Caching is a technique that allows you to store frequently accessed data in a temporary storage location. This can help to reduce the number of requests to your server and improve the overall performance of your website.
