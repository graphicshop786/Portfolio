# Optimizing Portfolio Performance

Core Web Vitals are essential for great UX and SEO. Here are a few wins I applied on this site:

## Fonts

Use `preconnect` and `preload` patterns to reduce blocking. Consider self-hosting if stable.

## Images

Add `sizes` and provide responsive `srcset` when possible. Prefer AVIF/WebP.

## JavaScript

Defer non-critical work with `requestIdleCallback` and mark scroll listeners as `passive`.

Happy optimizing!
