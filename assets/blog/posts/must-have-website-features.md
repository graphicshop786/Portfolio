# 5 Must-Have Features for Your Business Website in 2025

Running a business website in 2025? Let me share what your customers expect from your website, based on my experience with real clients.

## 1. Fast Loading Speed: The Basics

Have you ever left a website because it took too long to load? Your customers feel the same way. Here's what I do to make websites fast:

- Optimize images (without making them blurry)
- Use modern hosting services
- Remove unnecessary plugins and scripts
- Enable caching

## 2. Mobile-First Design: More Important Than Ever

Look around - everyone's on their phones. Your website must work perfectly on mobile devices. Here's what that means:

- Text that's easy to read without zooming
- Buttons big enough to tap with your thumb
- Menus that work well on small screens
- Forms that are easy to fill on phones

## 3. Easy Contact Options

Make it super easy for customers to reach you. I always include:
- A clear contact form
- Your phone number
- Business hours
- Location map (if you have a physical store)
- Links to your social media

The best part? When you make it easy to contact you, more people actually do!

## 4. Clear Information About Your Services

Don't make people guess what you offer. I always tell my clients:
- List your services clearly
- Include prices if possible
- Show examples of your work

- Answer common questions

## 5. Security Features

Customers care about their safety online. Every website I build includes:
- SSL certificate (the padlock in the browser)
