Portfolio — Bilal Hussain
=========================

A static portfolio website for Bilal Hussain. The site is built with plain HTML/CSS/JS and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Project pages live under the `projects/` directory and several data files (JSON) are available under `assets/js/` for reference.

Quick overview
--------------

- Static site (no backend). All pages are static HTML under the repository root.
- Project pages: `projects/1.html` … `projects/8.html` (one page per project).
- Main styles: `assets/css/styles.css` (generated by Tailwind from `assets/css/input.css`).
- Source JSON data: `assets/js/projects.json`, `assets/js/testimonials.json`, etc.
- Key scripts: Tailwind CLI is used to build/watch CSS.

Requirements
------------

- Node.js (for Tailwind build step, optional if you use the prebuilt CSS in `assets/css/styles.css`).
- npm (to run the Tailwind CLI script)

Local development (quick)
-------------------------

1. Serve the folder locally (any static server). Example using Python (recommended for quick smoke tests):

```powershell
# from the repository root (Windows PowerShell)
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Build and watch Tailwind CSS (optional)
--------------------------------------

If you want to edit Tailwind input and rebuild CSS locally, install dependencies and run the watch script:

```powershell
npm install
npm run build:css
```

This runs the Tailwind CLI in watch mode and outputs `assets/css/styles.css` from `assets/css/input.css`.

Notes and structure
-------------------

- `index.html` is the homepage.
- Project detail pages are static at `projects/*.html` (they were generated from `assets/js/projects.json`). If you prefer a dynamic approach, you can restore the JSON-driven renderer (previously removed) and use a single template.
- `assets/js/main.js` contains site-wide JavaScript (UI interactions, animations, and small data-driven rendering).
- `assets/css/styles.css` is the generated stylesheet (Tailwind + custom rules). If you change `assets/css/input.css`, run the Tailwind build step to regenerate `styles.css`.

Recommendations / next steps
---------------------------

- Run a Lighthouse audit to pick up performance and accessibility improvements.
- Consider keeping the project JSON and a client-side renderer if you want easier updates to project pages (instead of editing 8 static HTML files).
- Add a CI workflow (GitHub Actions) to run HTML/CSS linting and optionally a Tailwind build step on push.
